        <h2>This is my Phase 1 Project </h2>

        <h3>
          For this project, my time-based media of choice was Music Visualization. I have always been keen on exploring this realm of technology and through this project I wanted to learn how I could combine some coding and my creativity to create my versions of these medias.<br>
<br>
          While researching I found that due to the development of high processing power, there were multiple softwares available to visualize music using their predefined algorithms. I found the idea of using algorithms to analyze music and manipulate the visual it produces, quite interesting. Which is why, I started to learn and develop my own versions of these algorithms using guidance from my professor.<br>
<br>
          Below are my first iterations of my algorithmic sound visualizers. <br></h3>

            <img src="iterationTwo.gif" align="right" width="50%" height="50%">
        </div>

          Observing these visuals and taking inspiration from the cube, I wanted to further develop my coding skills to make a more complex visual of the cube by creating a more repetitive form to further tie it into my aesthetic.</p></h3>
<br>
        <div>
           <img src="iterationThree.gif" align="left" width="50%" height="50%">
            <img src="iterationFour.gif" align="right" width="50%" height="50%">
        </div>

<br><h3>
          I was pretty excited with this outcome because I was able to map different levels of frequencies into different parts of this cube, but I kept exploring and refining this visual to form the one below. I sort off combined the idea of a cube shape but formed by an array of spheres which created a very intricate and ambiguous visual.<br></h3>

          In order to synthesize and display my process I decided to create a 60 second visual reacting to some music, you can find it below. <br></h3>

<h3>
          Exploration of Future Direction:<br>
<br>
          While learning how to create visualizers I explored the topic of Augmented Reality, hoping to combine the two topics to create 3D visualizers which could be experienced through our smartphones and AR devices such as Microsoft HoloLens.<br>
<br>
          I tried using marker-based augmented reality to superimpose a 3D Box in my physical environment. Through this exploration I was investigating whether some of my visualizers could be connected to this realm of design to create a very novel experience of music, at the comfort of sitting at home.<br>
